I am using as much channels as possible to make receiving updates for my blog easier to you.

So, you can subscribe to my [Telegram](https://t.me/strlistint) channel, [Twitter](https://twitter.com/xni) or by email.

This repo contains a list of emails, I'm sending a message to, when a new blog post is there.
